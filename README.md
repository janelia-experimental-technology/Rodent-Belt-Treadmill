# Rodent-Belt-Treadmill
Low friction belt treadmill for use in space constrained experimental rigs


Designed at HHMI's Janelia research campus, this treadmill is relatively small and inexpensive compared to most existing designs. It is manually driven with an encoder to track the movement of the belt. Some of the users make use of this sensor, but it is not necessary for all. For the users that do not monitor the position or can use their own data acquisition systems, all that is needed are the parts documented in the zip file. Fundamentally, it can be used as a free turning manual treadmill.

It may be used for natural action (e.g., walking) for the mouse to take during an experiment instead of standing still. For example, some users let the mice walk normally on the treadmill and then play a tone the mouse associates with a trained response to see if the mouse will start or stop moving.

Advantages: This was designed to fit underneath MIMMS 2P microscopes where space is limited. There are now some commercial options available based on this design, as well as other commercial options.

Interface: These may be placed under an imaging microscope or other behavioral setup with a head-fixed rodent on it. There is an encoder that some users take advantage of. Encoder interfaces are documented here and on Flintbox
Control: Users have plugged the encoder outputs directly into their lab data acquisition setups. 

Operation: Researchers can physically mount the treadmill and place the mouse on top of it. The encoder does not have to be connected, but it does have to be connected to a data acquisition system or other devices if it is desired to record or analyze the motion.

Opportunity: Free to make for Non-Profit Research by downloading the design here or on FLintbox.
